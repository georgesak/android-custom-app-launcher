# Custom App Launcher

A simple Android application that serves as a custom home screen launcher. It displays a list of installed applications, allows the user to launch them, remembers the last launched app, and provides a persistent notification to easily return to the app picker.

## Features

*   Displays a list of installed applications with their icons and names.
*   Launches selected applications.
*   Remembers the last launched application and opens it directly on subsequent launches (unless accessed via the notification).
*   Persistent notification to quickly return to the app picker.
*   Button to open the device's home settings to change the default launcher.
*   Filters out applications without a launchable UI.
